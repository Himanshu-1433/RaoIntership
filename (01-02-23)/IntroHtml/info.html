            <h1>What is BCA?</h1>
            <p>The term BCA stands for Bachelor of Computer Applications. A three-year undergraduate degree in
                technology and computer applications is known as a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). In this
                course, students will learn about a variety of computer applications as well as how to solve
                computer-related issues. Students in the BCA degree learn about networking, data structures, programming
                languages like Java and C++, as well as careers in IT and software.
                Numerous specializations are available in the BCA Course. Among the many courses offered are subjects
                like Network Systems, Internet Technologies, Computer Graphics, System Analysis, and Database Management
                System. BCA specializations can also include HTML, Java, C++, and many more.</p>
            <p>Students need a 12th-level qualification in the field of science or preferably computer application. At
                least 50% marks are required in the eligibility criteria.
                There are many colleges in India from where a BCA degree can be pursued. The average fee in such
                colleges ranges from INR 2 to INR 3 LPA.
                If any student desires to study BCA outside India from any foreign University, it will be mandatory to
                qualify for a language test including TOEFL, PTL, or IELTS. In addition to this, passing the GMAT or GRE
                will also be necessary.
                Websites such as edX, Coursera, and others are offering BCA in online mode.
                The syllabus of BCA is entirely composed of programming and networking. Some subjects in the BCA
                curriculum are computer networks, data structure, operating systems, hardware lab, client-server
                computing, UML, OOAD, etc.
                One can study MBA in Information Management and MCA after completing BCA.</p>

                    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
                        to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style
                        Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                        documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                        and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                        document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
                        describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers
                        according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS
                        specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
                        recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be
                        a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of
                        the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites
                        use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party
                        libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
                        users' devices.

                        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                        standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                        functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                        styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                        expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
