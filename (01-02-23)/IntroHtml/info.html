            <h1>What is BCA?</h1>
            <p>The term BCA stands for Bachelor of Computer Applications. A three-year undergraduate degree in
                technology and computer applications is known as a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). In this
                course, students will learn about a variety of computer applications as well as how to solve
                computer-related issues. Students in the BCA degree learn about networking, data structures, programming
                languages like Java and C++, as well as careers in IT and software.
                Numerous specializations are available in the BCA Course. Among the many courses offered are subjects
                like Network Systems, Internet Technologies, Computer Graphics, System Analysis, and Database Management
                System. BCA specializations can also include HTML, Java, C++, and many more.</p>
            <p>Students need a 12th-level qualification in the field of science or preferably computer application. At
                least 50% marks are required in the eligibility criteria.
                There are many colleges in India from where a BCA degree can be pursued. The average fee in such
                colleges ranges from INR 2 to INR 3 LPA.
                If any student desires to study BCA outside India from any foreign University, it will be mandatory to
                qualify for a language test including TOEFL, PTL, or IELTS. In addition to this, passing the GMAT or GRE
                will also be necessary.
                Websites such as edX, Coursera, and others are offering BCA in online mode.
                The syllabus of BCA is entirely composed of programming and networking. Some subjects in the BCA
                curriculum are computer networks, data structure, operating systems, hardware lab, client-server
                computing, UML, OOAD, etc.
                One can study MBA in Information Management and MCA after completing BCA.</p>

                            to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style
                            Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                            documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
